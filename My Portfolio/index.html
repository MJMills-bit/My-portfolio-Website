            The site took shape around the idea of bringing the service of
            landscaping online. Lots of natural materials were used in the
            styling of the site. I Tried to keep it simple by focusing on what
            most browsers are comfortable with.
          </p>
          <p>
            The layout is being centered around the click and scroll influence
            of the user. Using a fixed background allowed me to create a depth
            aspect to the site which in turn gave some depth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Effects were added to enhance the experience and showcase not only
            the CSS but the Javascript too. Even the addition of the blog was a
            welcoming section for the site. Adding some interactive qualities to
            the site.

          <p>
            In this project I focused on the use of a 3rd party API (RAWG) to
            gather and display information. This was done using Javascript and
            CSS. I introduce bootstrap after noticing the mobile version did not scale to my expectations. The change improve the responsive layout of the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating a card that displays the image as well as the title and two
            button options for gamestores that sells the game online. This
            project taught me quite a few things regarding patience and that
            there is always another solution to a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            A customized logo was use to make it feel more modern and the
            background was also made specially to give the indication of a
            futuristic site.

            The ease of accessing already built in features in Local created and
            written by the WP engine. It allowed me to layer the features as I
            desired. I added link to the photos' that take a browser to a site
            with all the information relative to that photo.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the Education+ website is a section which has links that take the
            browser to play an assortment of games that fall under that specific
            category(Explore Math). The last sections include a video of
            interesting facts as well as blogs about current and important
            topics.

          <p>
            There is also a contact form which allows one to get information
