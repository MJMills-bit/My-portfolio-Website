# My portfolio Website &#129309;
 A website containing revelvant information about my profession as a Web Dev
<h1>Focal points &#129299;</h1>
<ul>
 <li>I combined a svg with the title of my Web development business. I added the pulse animation to draw the user's attention. </li>
 <li>The color scheme I used was more toward a dark theme. A linear gradient was used on the background as well as some other elements. This allows the buttons, shadows and containers to be highlighted. </li>
 <li> I added an animation to the card with a rotate tranformation to reveal the back of the card. This part contains a button with a link that directs the user to profile section. I added some styling to the h1 tag using a text-shadow effect. The button too has the pulse animation active. </li>
 <li> The pulse effect was added to the buttons, box-shadows and to the logo. Every where I want to draw the users attention to.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Areas of improvement &#128187;</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Add the css styling that adds a fixed position to the nav-bar above the profile section until a certain Y-axis point.  </li>
 <li>I want to add a toggle button for a light and dark theme. </li>
 <li>Change the position of the information container. I will also add a fade in effect with a change in font family.This will be triggered by the event listener. </li>
</ul>
